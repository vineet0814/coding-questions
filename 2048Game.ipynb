    "In this problem, you will implement a simulator for the hit mobile game, 2048.\n",
    "\n",
    "2048 consists of a 4 x 4 grid. At the beginning of the game, the grid is empty:\n",

    ".,.,.,.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(We've chosen to use commas to separate the game spaces and periods to represent empty spaces.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round consists of a movement (up, down, left, or right) and an added piece. First, tiles slide as far as they can in the direction of the movement. If two identical tiles collide while moving, they merge into a tile with the total value of the tiles that just collided. Here's an example: if one moves up on this board:\n",

    "\n",
    ".,.,.,.\n",
    "\n",
    ".,.,.,.\n",

    "Tiles must be identical to combine. If three tiles combine, only the two farthest in the direction of motion combine. For example, if this board moves right:\n",

    "If four tiles are in a row or column, a move parallel to that row or column combines the first two and the last two (e.g. 2,2,2,2 --> 4,4). Also, the result of two tiles combining cannot collide again in the same turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the move is complete, a new value is placed at a provided X and Y coordinate. The new value must be placed after the movement for that round is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will receive a list of moves formatted as strings. Each move will be in the following format:\n",

    "Direction X Y Value\n",

    "where:\n",
    "- Direction := {U, D, L, R} (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- X and Y are zero-indexed (between 0 and 3 inclusive), with the top row and leftmost column being 0, and the bottommost row and rightmost column being 3. For example, the (X, Y) coordinates of the top left corner, top right corner, bottom left corner, and bottom right corner should be (0, 0), (3, 0), (0, 3), and (3, 3) respectively.\n",
    "- Value is is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each movement should be evaluated first, followed by the corresponding new value. If at any point a value is inserted in a position that is already occupied, return the string Error. Else, return the board state at the end of all the rounds, formatted as above. Each cell should contain the number contained herein or . if empty each row should contain all four of its cells, separated by , the board should be separated by newlines ('\\n') there should be no newline at the end of the output\n",
